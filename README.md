# About Me
## My intrests
    - I started this degree persuing a career that could financially stabalize my self. Now that I've matured, I realized, sure I want the money but most of all I want to make a difference in this world and provide help to those who need it the most. Recently, I discovered a way to do exactly that with this education. I've found purpose that exceeds my materialistic wants. 
## Websites I recommend. 
    - [Youtube] (https://www.youtube.com/) - Youtube is the companion you want when eating lunch in a room full of people you could talk to. 
    - [Webull] (https://www.webull.com/) Webull reminds me of the __sweet highs__ of life as well as the devestating lows that've built the resilience in my character.
