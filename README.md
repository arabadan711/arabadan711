# About me

## My intrests

I started this degree persuing a career that could financially stabalize my self. Now that I've explored more opptunities these skills could bring me, I realized, sure I want the money, but most of all I want to make a difference in this world and provide help to those kids who need it the most. Recently, I discovered a way to do exactly that with this education. I've found purpose that exceeds my materialistic wants.

## Websites I recommend

- [ Youtube ] (<https://www.youtube.com/>) - Youtube is the companion you want when eating lunch in a room full of people you could talk to. All jokes, vut Youtube seriously helps visualize anything I need help learning with.
- [ Webull ] (<https://www.webull.com/>) Webull reminds me of the *sweet highs* of life as well as the devestating lows that've built the resilience in my character.
